# streamlit-chat

This is a Streamlit chatbox demo working with chatGPT. But due to the restriction of text_area component, only pure text format supported in the chat box.

I'm going to implement another version in next project with cool features like voice chat, langchain integration with private API etc.

Note: sidebar and topbar reactions are not implemented yet.
